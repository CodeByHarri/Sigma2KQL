// Description: Detects the presence of unicode characters which are homoglyphs, or identical in appearance, to ASCII letter characters.
This is used as an obfuscation and masquerading techniques. Only "perfect" homoglyphs are included; these are characters that
are indistinguishable from ASCII characters and thus may make excellent candidates for homoglyph attack characters.
